        <p>It is that time of year when Apple is poised to release yet another version of the iPhone. I recall my first
          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone>iPhone</a>, the orginal, which I beat up fairly well. I bought it with the intent of jailbreaking it and running it of T-Mobile. I upgraded to the 3G a year later but this time I opted to sign up for an AT&amp;T contract. When the
          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4>iPhone 4</a> came out the 3G was slugish and I loved the ascetic look of the 4 and yes I did upgrade to the
          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4s>iPhone 4S</a>, mostly for well I don’t know
          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_v4.0>Bluetooth 4.0</a>. When Apple first announced the 4 I really couldn’t think of anything else I would want in a phone, err, pocket sized handheld mobile computer. So what could the iPhone [5s/6] offer that would compel me to upgrade again next
          year? I am nearly certain the iPhone 5 will sport LTE, improved processing power, improved camera and a new dock port. The geek in me is looking forward to LTE, I didn’t want it last year, and I always welcome improved processing power. Dock
          ports, I honestly don’t care one way of the other, and I really don’t take enough pictures to really care.
          <p>What’s left for the 2013 iPhone? Processor/RAM/battery improvements.
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication>NFC</a>? That sound grand but would I find it useful in daily life? I know I would love to have less to carry around with me. However would enough terminals exist in my daily life that honor the Apple version of NFC? Doubtful. Would I really
            use the NFC bits in the phone if I can’t use it on a regular basis? Very unlikely.
            <p>I can’t wait to see what is announced tomorrow, nor can wait for the 2013 speculation to begin.</article>
