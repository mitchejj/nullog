        <p>My final vacation for the year is just around the corner, which of course I’m looking forward to. I have spent the last week thinking of different projects I want to tackle over the week. I of course want to fin down some of the details to my
          January vacation plans… the quantitative self side of things.
          <p>I played my order for the Magellan Echo, which I plan on using all four days of the Dopey Challenge. When I started my running journey I didn’t know if this running thing would stick with me long term. I had no reason to think about buying a
            running watch, my iPhone everything I needed and then some. It still does, but I hate arm bands and would like to have indulge in my quantitative self data at various points along my runs.
            <p>Early on I tried the ever so popular RunKeeper, something about it just didn’t feel right. I might have been I felt like my quantitative self data was being locked into the RunKeeper ecosystem. I found my escape with Runmeter and since version
              9.1.1 all of the Abvieao-meter apps have supported the Wahoo Fitness RFLKT ‘bike computer’ display system. While Abvieao has been quite of the the Echo, apparently the Echo is essentially a RFLKT wearable device… and the Wahoo Fitenss app
              supports Echo so I hope I can use use the Echo with Runmeter. I surely hope it does, and I definitely will be spending a portion of my vacation tinkering with the the different screens.

                <p>We held off on supporting it because of other priorities.
                  <p>…
                    <p>They share an API, but there are subtle differences (like the fact that the Echo display is round). I do expect that we’ll support it, but I don’t know when yet. But we’re getting a couple of them here. That’s usually a good first
                      step. <small><cite>Abvio Support email</cite></small></blockquote>
