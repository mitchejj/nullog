        <p>This may sound like a horror story at first but I assure you it isn’t. I wanted to find a lightweight shoe comfortable to wear daily, with a low toe to heal drop. However this shoe wasn’t intended to be used for daily use but as a gym workout
          shoe. Over the winter I’ve been eyeing up
          <a href=http://www.skechers.com/info/gorun2>Sketchers GOrun</a>
          <sup id=fn1r-2013-06-06>
            <a href=#fn1-2013-06-06>1</a>
          </sup> line from a distance. Just a few weeks ago I stopped by my local Skechers Outlet, and picked up a new pair of shoes. I know, I’m bad for buying running shoes from a ‘big box’ store let alone an outlet. Don’t judge me just yet, I went shopping
          for work shoes and walked out with a pair of work shoes and
          <a href=http://skechersperformance.com/running/mens#/53555-gorun2>Skechers GOrun 2</a>.
          <p>So far I must say I’m impressed as they just find a way on my feet, I’ve taken them few runs and gym trips. I did try going for a run without the insole liners. I was amazed how much of a difference the liners makes; I can see why people would
            enjoy this feel however after one run I don’t its for me.
            <p>Overall I must say the GOrun2 is currently favorite shoe. I don’t know if I could run any real distance in such a minimial shoe, I am going to try. I started my transition to a ‘minimal shoe’ last year with the Brooks Pure Flow, I enjoyed
              the fit and feel of that shoe as well. As a whole I think the Pure line is was constructed to a higher standard. The only exception to that is the sole, feel the GOrun will last a bit longer as the miles build up.

                    <p>the goRun has a 4mm drop, and on a geekier sidenote, to bad Skechers didn’t fallow camel case and name the shoe goRun or goRUN.
