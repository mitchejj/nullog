        <p>A month ago I thought I found my RSS reader solution in
          <a href=https://www.commafeed.com/>CommaFeed</a>. However, after using it for a few days I found it just wasn’t what I needed. In fact I found it to be painfully slow. So I looked for alternative solutions and found
          <a href=https://github.com/swanson/stringer>Stringer</a>. It is by far one of the best solutions I found. Yet it too had a problem, sometimes I’m not in the mood to read tech news, and wish to indulge in something else… and Stringer lacks folders.
          <p>I also looked at
            <a href=http://www.goread.io>Go Read</a>, but I don’t like the fact it is tied to my Google account. I found something I could live with, for now,
            <a href=http://www.feedafever.com/>Fever</a>. Now it isn’t perfect, but it does auto update, which is fantastic for a self hosted app. It also supports folders, and as and API implemented by other apps. The fact Fever has an API used by other Apps to me is very important as
            I honestly feel the native web UX &amp; UI is shamefully sub par. Now that I have a nice collect of feeds that I wish to follow I now find myself wanting to trim back a bit. Not only am I overwhelmed by the sheer number of stories, but the
            aforementioned web interface makes reading my feeds a less than pleasurable experience. I suppose if my display had a higher resolution I might feel a little different.
            <p>However, I do have a new plan, I will supplement my fever install with an install of Stringer. To me Stringer really excels with an easy to read interface. If spin a Stringer install and have it manage whatever my short term interest might
              be I think I will be a happy boy yet again.</article>
