        <p>I was a huge watch person in the later years of high school and most of my college life. Then sometime in my senior year I stop wearing a watch. It wasn’t until early this year I start wearing a watch on a semi-regular basis.
          <p>But first let me back track, once I decided I was going to make an attempt at the Goofy Challenge in `13 I wanted to find a way to track my effort in a quantitative way. I thought the best method would be using a hear rate monitor. My main running
            gadget/companion up d to then had been my iPhone. Before the iPhone 4s if you wanted to use any fitness gadgets that would interact with an app on a smart phone you choice was ANT+ and a dongle. I just purchased an iPhone 4s which support
            for Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Smart), so the obvious choice was the
            <a href=http://www.wahoofitness.com/wahoo-blue-hr-heart-rate-strap.html>Wahoo Fitness Blue HR</a>. I used it for some time, but I son realized it wasn’t exactly what I wanted. I wasn’t a fan of the strap.
            <p>Shortly after I started to cool on the HR Blue, I learned of the a new
              <a href=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alphaheartrate/alpha-the-holy-grail-of-heart-rate-look-ma-no-hand title="ALPHA - the Holy Grail of Heart Rate (Look Ma, no hands!)">Kickstarter project</a> the
              <a href=http://www.mioglobal.com/>Mio Alpha</a>, a heart rate monitor watch. The watch is great for the uni-tacker functionality it provides. I been slight curious of the smart watches entering the market over the last year, all of them like Pebble, never excited me the
              all seemed more like a niche-fad than a useful product. That was until a few days ago when I read an execet review of the
              <a href=http://www.magellangps.com/Echo>Magellan Echo</a> over at
