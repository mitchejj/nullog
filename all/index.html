        <p>Last year was the first year I ran this event. Mentally I felt down for most of the race, physically I felt a bit off; I ran my fast official half marathon it was also the last race I ran. This year, I was in a good place mentally but a tad unsure
          physically. When I signed up I wanted to better last years time, my goal time was 2:10.
          <p>I felt the best way to accomplish this feat was to run smart, and have negative splits. The backside of the half mostly comprised segments from my daily running routes, surely that would give me ‘mental’ lift. I felt strong for the first 6 miles,
            with a nice pace; then it happened. No I didn’t hit the wall, the slight nagging pain in my left knee wanted some attention. The next 7 miles was less than ideal yet I managed to finish a tad over 2:20. Heading into the last week I kind of
            expected I would run a 2:20, goal accomplished?

            <p>This year also marked the first rendition of the full marathon for this race. I do think that took away some of the overall organization found in last years race. For instance, day one of the expo seemed a bit disorganized, the first water
              station was out of water (the also ran out of GU at the GU stop), some mile markers seemed misplaced, and the event organizers still have yet to figure out a bull horn is not the best way to disseminate information at the start of a race.
              It’s a hard job, and I’m sure adding a full marathon to the slate of events is a daunting task. We always notice the little, and sometimes big, things that go wrong; we often overlook hundreds of items that work and worked well.
              <p>I’m just left with one question, when did they change the full marathon route? I know the route the participants ran seemed saner compared to the orginal plan.
                <p>Oh, and the finish line pizza just seemed better this year, total win.

        <p>Last year I had many plans 2014, running wise. After the Dopey Challenge I didn’t do much and only finished one other event. For that event,
          <a href=http://www.letsmovefestival.com/>Let’s Move Festival of Races</a>, I didn’t do any training. I also entered
          <a href=http://konarunningcompany.com/>Kona Running Company’s</a>
          <a href=http://www.konarun.com/>Kona Run</a>, a massive fail. A few days earlier I had eye lid surgery, I miss-calculated the drive time and missed the start of the race partly due to to the eye lid surgery. Then towards the end of the year I tried complete the monthly strava
          Half-marathon challenge — to have at least one 13.1 or greater run. Once the weather turned cold the days grew shorter I found it difficult to find time run let alone squeeze in 13.1 mile run.

        <p>The choice to move to Heroku was made just under two and a half years ago; since that time Unicorn has been the primary server of choice, with a short flirtation with Puma. Lets be honest this site gets very little traffic before removing my visit
          or the search bots. Yet, the desire to have quick response times, load times, able to serve thousands of request per second, and not be a resource hog has had always been my mission. A free Heroku Dyno with Unicorn has been a steller choice.
          The choice between Unicorn and Puma was difficult, performance was nearly indistinguishable, and some benchmarks show
          <a href=http://www.madebymarket.com/blog/dev/ruby-web-benchmark-report.html>Unicorn was the superior choice</a>, for my usage. Of couse, me being me I’ve been itching to change things up.
          <p>Enter
            <a href=http://www.rubyraptor.org/how-we-made-raptor-up-to-4x-faster-than-unicorn-and-up-to-2x-faster-than-puma-torquebox/>Raptor aka Passenger 5</a> which is “up to 4x faster than Unicorn, up to 2x faster than Puma, Torquebox”. If this is true, switch must be made. At moment Passenger 5 is still in beta, beta software in the production environment is a big no-no.
            I’m not running mission critical software, I’m not running a website real demands. While the initial testing looks promising Passenger isn’t a good fit, yet, as route queue time is up drastically resulting in longer wait times by the end client.
            <p>Since the underpinnings of the site, the server, where front of mind it makes plenty of sense to assess the current landscape to go back and retested my setup with with both Unicorn and Puma; make a few ‘tuning tweaks’ and see if an improved
              balance between resources and performance can be struck; the new server of choice seems to be Puma.
              <p>My test methodology harken back to some test I did with the old jekyll site. This time I used
                <a href=https://github.com/wg/wrk><code>wrk</code></a> opposed to <code>ab</code> then did something like:<pre><code class=lang-shell>   wrk -t16 -c16 -d10s --latency http://www.nullog.net/
</code></pre>
                <p>I suppose that would do, but I wanted to see what was going on server side. For that I found Heroku Labs has and add on called
                  <a href=https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-runtime-metrics title="Per-dyno stats on memory use, swap use, and load average are inserted into the app’s log stream"><code>log-runtime-metrics</code></a>. I could then use the
                  <a href=https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/librato><code>Librato</code></a> add-on (for fancy graphs) and/or
                  <a href=https://log2viz.herokuapp.com/ title="Realtime analysis of your Heroku app logs"><code>log2viz</code></a>; and since these solutions are reading from the server logs the

        <p>[^goRUN]: I don’t think I’ve hidden the fact I’ve turned into a huge fan of the Skechers GOrun lineup. While I haven’t seen nor tried the GOrun 4’s I must admit I am skeptical at what I’ve initially seen trickle out prior to the NYC Marathon.
          However, I enjoy digesting the reviews as I slowly find them… and with each review I find myself looking forward to the trying them out myself.</article>

          for part of my vacation and more agonizing the death of a long friendship. As a result I haven’t given this site much attention.</article>

        <p>I don’t want to go dwell to much on the
          <a href=/about/history>evolution of my online presence</a>. For nearly two years this site has been built upon the awesomeness that is
          <a href=http://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a>. Over the two years I’ve learned a lot, I’ve also made may mistakes. I do feel in many ways Jekyll with GitHub is nearly a perfect platform for most users. Yet I wanted more and moved the hosting to Heroku. I had the inclination I
          still wanted more back in November when I started to ‘refactor’ the site design. I think I need to move, and today I am making that change by moving from Jekyll to
          <a href=http://middlemanapp.com/ title="makes developing websites simple">Middleman</a>.
          <p>I can’t point to one issue or desire that prompted the change. The reasons I originally choose Jekyll are no longer compelling
            <sup id=fnr1-2014-07-14>
              <a href=#fn1-2014-07-14>1</a>
            </sup>. With all choices have have trade offs. This move allows me to erase inherited technical debt

              <a href=#fn2-2014-07-14>2</a>
            </sup> while putting thoughtful purpose behind the choice I make while giving me the headroom to grow and explore
            <sup id=fnr3-2014-07-14>
              <a href=#fn3-2014-07-14>3</a>

                  <p>I no longer use GitHub, let alone gh-pages, so the tight integration between Jekyll and GitHub mute. Conversly I love the fact Middleman-
                    <a href=https://github.com/middleman/middleman-livereload>livereload</a> also generates assets.

                      <p>My code base started as a clone of
                        <a href=http://jekyllbootstrap.com/>JekyllBootstrap</a>, while you do go from nothing to something in 3 minutes, the site lacked ‘thoughtful purpose’ on my part. Also, did get tired of Liquid and how Liquid cause Jekyll to produce some nasty looking source code.

                              <strong>I still wholeheartedly endorse Jekyll.</strong> It is still a great static generator and a great tool I could see using again.

        <p>While my trusty MacBook (4,2) has been my workhorse for sometime, and while it do undergo some life saving surgery last year it really is starting to show its age. I hoped my Mac Mini would help push back the need yet another year. But it hasn’t
          and while the idea of building my own system seems alluring I know I will be left wanting a portable system. I know I should wait to WWDC until I replace the system but…
          <p>Of all the ‘other’ laptops I’ve seen they have one problem I can’t get around, no not the cheap build feel… but the track pad is not centered. So I was left looking between the MacBook Air and Pro. In the end I went with what will have the longest
            use life, the Pro and bumped out the specs. I know I love having millions of tabs open in my browser so I need plenty of RAM, since the HD is upgradeable I should go with something a tad on the larger side and since I’m buying to use the system
            for years I should also go with and i7. I might not need all of these ‘extra’ bits today but I will 2-3 years from now.
            <p>But that leads to another question. Should I install Arch or stick with OS X… or dual boot. For now I think I will move back to OS X as my main system. And keep Arch on the the MacBooks and Mini. In the realm exploration of I was thinking
              of using chef to try and make the system setup bit automated. Do I really want to visit 10-15 sites download, then drag-n-drop? Not really.
              <p>For the setup automation I eventually choose to use a Mac OS X front end to chef called
                <a href=https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan>Kitchenplan</a>. While it does seem like a fantastic way to get started. However, for me it is overkill for sure, but I think I would use something similar again.
                <p>The biggest problem with my new MacBook Pro? I can’t stand the current layout/design of the site. It is far beyond hideous, so I once again have an excuse to started tinker. Honestly it what I enjoy most about the site, so maybe its a
                  bonus.</article>

        <p>One 1/3 of the year is gone. While the year started bang, since then I haven’t been running much. My desire to road has been dampened by the ‘harsh’ 2013-14 winter weather.
          <p>Yet, I’m still looking ahead at what my 2014 running goals might consist off. For the last two years I’ve been consumed with the Goofy and Dopey challenges. I love the runDisney events, I love getting away to warmer weather… but I need a slight
            break from the runDisney events. I know I will be kicking myself in late October for passing on the Wine &amp; Dine again this year. I will feel like the perfect chance of complete the Cost-to-Cost Challenge slipped away when the first Avengers
            Half marathon nears. I’m nearly certainly want to be in Florida running when Marathon Weekend rolls around in January.
            <p>I wanted this year to be a local year, and start out with the
              <a href=https://www.53riverbankrun.com/>Fifth Third River Bank Run</a>. The race is the largest 25k race in the country, the event even has a
              <a href=https://www.53riverbankrun.com/5k-25k-combo.php>5k/25k combo</a>. I seem to enjoy doing these challenges, so maybe… but what about the fall? I could stay hyper-local and run the
              <a href=http://www.thebrooksieway.com/>Brooksie</a>. I didn’t get excited with either of those races.
              <p>Then I learned about the
                <a href=http://www.groundhogmarathon.com/>Ground Hog Marathon &amp; Half Marathon</a>, and reading the FAQ the event seemed intriguing… but that is definitely not a race I would like to try anytime soon. However, I found out the race director also puts on the
                <a href=http://grandrapidsmarathon.com/>Grand Rapids Marathon</a> and I just love Grand Rapids. While I don’t want to put in the time and effort to run another full marathon I also have a deep desire to run another full. So in the back of my mind I’ve been targeting this race.
                <p>I still needed to do something in the spring. One late night I ventured online and purchased a bed, then I entered the uber-local
                  <a href=http://www.letsmovefestival.com/>Let’s Move Festival of Races</a>. It is so local I can walk to the start line.
                  <p>Then today, I found out
                    <a href=https://www.cedarpoint.com/>Cedar Point</a> has an inaugural half marathon coming up, and since
                    <a href=https://www.visitkingsisland.com>Kings Island</a> is also a “local” park (and worth a visit) and they are the same company I wondered if they have a race as well… and they do. One is in the spring the other is the fall. Maybe this will be a nice runDisney replacement?
                    <p>I have to May 15th decide upon the Grand Rapids Marathon.</article>

        <p>Online shopping isn’t anything new to me, after all I was one of the first people to buy and HD TV online way back when… then when had my last eye check up and prescription I went to
          <a href=https://warbyparker.com/>Warby Parker</a>. The experience was rather quick and simple. Now when I’m looking to buy a new bed I’m following suit. However, I never thought about buying the little daily things online. I started looking into changing that by buying my shaving
          needs online from
          <a href=https://www.harrys.com/>Harrys</a>.
          <p>For some reason I felt the need to do a little research before making this particular purchase. I really don’t know why but I did… and who would have guested a site dedicated to “personal grooming intelligence for consumers by consumers” called
            <a href=http://www.razorpedia.com/>razorpedia</a> exist. Sometimes the simple things lead to the odd ball finds.
            <p>What did I think of my shaving set from Harry’s? First, I’ve only used the Mach line in the past; the Harry’s blades seem nice, albeit a bit narrower than I would have expected. I wouldn’t say they are any better or worse than what a person
              would find in the Mach lineup. I elected for the Truman handle, as I don’t need a luxury handle. I did feel the handle asperity lacking a little something to grip on to when your hands are wet and slippery. I also haven’t been able to figure
              out how to remove the blade heads… and finally the shaving cream. I’m not a fan, but I’m not a fan of shaving creams in general and prefer gels. I will have to give the cream a few more trials before I render my final judgment.</article>

        <p>When I chose to think about moving away from Bootstrap I need to find few plumbing/framework replacements. I like
          <a href=http://bourbon.io/>Bourbon</a> along with
          <a href=http://neat.bourbon.io/>Neat</a>. I always wanted some ‘help’ on the typeset side of things, and

          <a href=http://bitters.bourbon.io/>Bitters</a>. I used all four.
          <p>Then I realized, just as I relied on Bootstrap, I was relying on these foundations. I decided I need to move away from the the support these frameworks provide in order to do my own thing. As I was finally feeling good about the direction I

                  something litle this playground that power can become an obstacle. Case currently OpenShift just supports ruby 1.8 and 1.9 out of the box… since I don’t require “stability” I can afford to run a bit more cutting edge so I prefer to run

                <p>The trip of course didn’t start as planned. The schedule flight out of DTW to MCO was canceled the previous morning due to weather conditions. I quickly called the airline and the earliest flight I could get to MCO was scheduled to land
                  at 755pm; the expo was scheduled to close at 8pm. The initial question of how do I get to Disney was replaced with how do make it to Disney in time to pick up my bib. Ah-ha drive, yes I will drive nearly 20 hours to make it in time for
                  bib pick up. The common sense intervened, and I choose to take the flight… but did I do the right thing? Surely not as I will be unable to run the 5k and thus unable to complete the Dopey Challenge.
                  <p>I started looking around on-line and even posted a question on a board what could I have done to have foreseen this issues… and someone pointed to a posting on twitter suggesting runDisney would allow bib pick-ups at the 5k, yet no official
                    word. Nearly 24-hours after my the airline canceled my flight I went into a slight freak out mode and thought of various was to ensure I could run all four races. One of which involved scanning and email documents to a family friend
                    was was picking my parents up from the airport at MCO. In all the rushing an panicking I some how left my drivers licensing on the flatbed of the scanner. Of course I didn’t realize this until checking my bags at the airport… oh the
                    stress. As it turns out the family friend was able to pick up my race packet just in time. I was able to run the 5k.
                    <p>Disney calls the 5k a family fun run, and as such I wasn’t to excited to see I was placed in the second to last coral. After all to officially complete the Dopey Challenge you must run all four races under the 16 minute per mile pace.
                      With that many family’s in front of me I dreading having to weave in and out between family’s. My original plan called for a 3 minute run 1 minute walk for the 5k and 10k. As I did speed a good deal of time weaving between people
                      I ditched the plan and basically run the entire course, of course I therefore ran much faster than I had anticipated.
                      <p>With the Minnie’s 10k the weather was nice, a mist hung in the air. I fared much better working my plan… but I didn’t exactly follow it. I did walk the hill but my walk intervals fell at odd places on the course. So I ran until I
                        felt like I might need a break. This strangely work really well, but alas I ran the 10k faster than I would have liked.
                        <p>Coming into the long events I felt good. My only concern so far had been my feet, well toes specifically. I’ve been worried about my footwear since mid November when my Brooks Ghost 6’s starting giving me issues. I was going to
                          use them to run the 5k and full marathon while opting to run the middle two events in my Brooks Defyance 5’s. I kept spinning trying to figure out a new plan and I eventually bought a pair of Skechers Go Run Ultra’s just before
                          Christmas.. and they arrived a few days after Christmas. They seemed to be a nicely cushioned lightweight shoe, I love my Go Run 2 and thought these would be great for the 5k and 10k and a nice shoe to walk around in after the
                          first two days. While I didn’t have much time to break them in prior to my trip I they really didn’t let me down… or did they? Early in the summer I switched from my dependable Adidas socks to Asics socks and never had a problem,
                          however after the first two days toes where feeling a bit tender. I switched by the the dependable Adidas socks for both the half and full marathons and I had zero issues. So I don’t know if it was the shoe of the socks. After
                          all I did walk around the parks all day with the same combo after completing the challenge…
                          <p>Okay, back to the races, the weather for the half marathon was anything but ideal. A dark cloud loomed in the distance at the start line, thankfully it never did rain. However, it was warm and very very humid, and every mile
                            seemed like a struggle. Contrast that to the breezy cool weather for full marathon where every step seemed effortless… well until later, but of of that in a bit. My plan here was similar walk the hills, but also walk the narrow
                            congested areas as well as using a 2:45 run 1:15 walk ratio. I honestly couldn’t hear the the prompts most of the race, but did eventually find the “grove” in the second half.
                            <p>Final day, the plan was to fix the issues from the previous day and stick to the plan and use the knowledge I gained from my first marathon last year… namely don’t buy into “the drink early and often” and the “if your thirsty
                              your already dehydrated” myths. Therefore I would only take one sip every other water station unless a.) I was washing down a gel b.) I felt like I need more fuel in the form of Power Aid. I must say everything worked like
                              a charm. I felt strong well into the late teen’s. I did have some mental wall issues to work through between mile 18 and 19 and started to feel like I may have hit the physical wall around mile 23ish… I did have enough in
                              me to sprint quarter mile. I finished strong and felt really good crossing the finish line. I didn’t feel overly sore, did hobble to much… just the step between a bus and a ground.
                              <p>I feel as if the weekend was a success, I didn’t over do it at the parks, and stayed in control of my race plans which allowed me to smashed my marathon PR/PB…

                <p>I feel as if I should start the year off with a posting, but I have no New Years resolutions nor do I have any lofty goals. So I am stuck what shall I write.
                  <p>The first challenge of the year will be the Doopy Challenge and I hope I find time to register for a few more events over the year. I hope to do a local event or two and I might consider doing RnR Chi again. Before I can consider those
                    I must find time to head back to the gym and do the work the get stronger in both my legs and core.
                    <p>When it comes to the site, I feel the changes I made over the last month and a half was just a stepping stone. All of the changes will help in moving the site to something a bit more modular and flexible. I just need to keep to the
                      baby steps method, and use git properly, I have a vision in mind now I just need a plan and the drive to execute it.</article>

                <p>So I quickly learned CloudFlare isn’t for me as it add to much overhead for such a minimal ROI. Around the same time I noticed my Bootsrap base was no longer current, I stumbled upon <code>jekyll-assets</code> and <code>bootstrap-sass</code>                  which started to get me thinking why not use the two and customize it for my needs and serve it all up as one file. It works faily well, which then lead me to wonder if I should keep using Bootstrap or find something a bit lighter. This
                  of course has caused slight stall in the refactor, do I:
                  <ol>
                    <li>continue the status quo and use bootstrap
                      <ul>
                        <li>leaving the current wild west mix in place
                          <li>clean up the mess with a customize bootstrap</ul>
                      <li>find a new frame work and implement the the change</ol>
                  <p>I think I the best solution is to keep the status quo with the current wild west mix in place. I think if I move to a new framework I might also be tempted to do some redesign work, which is outside the scope of the refactor… but it
                    may happen.</article>

                <p>As I mentied before, I think the time has come to refactor the sites stack. First and foremost I wanted to be enable to deploy a test version of the site locally, running just like it would in the server production environment. I don’t
                  know why but this didn’t work well with
                  <a href=http://jonasforsberg.se/2012/07/22/jekyll-heroku-unicorn title="Jekyll + Heroku + Unicorn = Blazing fast blogging">my old method</a>. I think it might had to do with using Rack:Jekyll, but I can’t be sure.
                  <p>I also wanted to move away from GitHub, while GitHub is a great service I don’t think what I’m doing here really is the right fit with GitHub. With this refactoring I’m moving to GitLab. While I do lose some functionality… an auto generated
                    backup site, and the use of prose.io. I have to be honest I don’t use prose, current version isn’t functionally useful with the site implementation. While what I gain with the move to GitLab offers somethings I wasn’t able to obtain
                    with GitHub, free private repos. For my needs and usage $84 is a little to costly. Also having a private wiki to keep notes that relate the the technical deployment of the site very appealing.

                <p>I was able to to bring my Digital Ocean ‘cloud’ up without to much trouble. I was able to bring up an ngix server, server up encrypted content all while keeping the all three version of the site in sync with the git repo.
                  <p>The hardest part was the how, what is the best way to keep the Digital Ocean version of the site up-to-date with the git repo. After some searching I stumbled across
                    <a href=http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/05/01/introducing-jekyll-hook/>jekyll-hook</a>, by the same creators of Prose. Now it wasn’t to difficult to configure and deploy. I only ran into to issues, and only one of them took time to figure out. What is the best method to keep a node app running and how
                    do you do that on a systemd server. The first part of the problem ended up being fairly simple, and use
                    <a href=http://blog.nodejitsu.com/keep-a-nodejs-server-up-with-forever>forever</a>. However, I’ve never crafted a systemd service file before, and I had no idea where to start. In the end the solution was really simple. I just needed one to create a
                    <a href=https://gist.github.com/mitchejj/7631695>jekyll-hook.service</a> file and install at <code>/etc/systemd/system/jekyll-hook.service</code>. I also use RVM to install ruby and gemset, so I also jekyll-hook build script (build-v1.sh), knows about RVM by properly sourcing it.
                    <p>While I enjoyed all of this, and love the idea hosting the site via https, I think I will be pulling down the sails and keep the site docked with heroku. When it comes down to it the price, free, is hard to beat. None of the basic
                      requirements have changed, I have a working stack which suits my needs… for now. However, now is the time to oil the gears and clear the cruft it is time to refactor the stack.
                      <p>I order to make the move really worth while I need to generate a spec sheet that would encompass more services that I currently rely on. In spirit, now is the time to oil the gears and clear the cruft it is time to refactor the stack.</article>

                <p>When I was spec-ing out a way to develop a site and return to the web my requirements where fairly simple. I wanted to avoid running or maintaining any of infrastructure. I first started using tumblr, moved to jekyll with github hosting,
                  then to heroku. They are all fine options. I am however am finding, what I always knew, I enjoy the technical side far more than content creation. I think I’m getting close to setting sail on my time at heroku and take my toys to a bigger
                  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a0a34d82deb4" title="Shameless Referal Link">Digital Ocean</a>.
                  <p>I started toying with this idea yesterday when I created an Arch ‘droplet’ to create a VPN connection for my digital devices when I’m out and about. I started to wonder would might it be ideal to start hosting my own email (bad idea)…
                    but I could and if I’m thinking about that why not movie other things I’m hosting of at TxD before they die off (again). If I do that then why not move my Jekyll install. I think I redrafted my late-fall vacation itinerary… but we
                    will see.

                        <p>My final vacation for the year is just around the corner, which of course I’m looking forward to. I have spent the last week thinking of different projects I want to tackle over the week. I of course want to fin down some of the
                          details to my January vacation plans… the quantitative self side of things.
                          <p>I played my order for the Magellan Echo, which I plan on using all four days of the Dopey Challenge. When I started my running journey I didn’t know if this running thing would stick with me long term. I had no reason to think
                            about buying a running watch, my iPhone everything I needed and then some. It still does, but I hate arm bands and would like to have indulge in my quantitative self data at various points along my runs.
                            <p>Early on I tried the ever so popular RunKeeper, something about it just didn’t feel right. I might have been I felt like my quantitative self data was being locked into the RunKeeper ecosystem. I found my escape with Runmeter
                              and since version 9.1.1 all of the Abvieao-meter apps have supported the Wahoo Fitness RFLKT ‘bike computer’ display system. While Abvieao has been quite of the the Echo, apparently the Echo is essentially a RFLKT wearable
                              device… and the Wahoo Fitenss app supports Echo so I hope I can use use the Echo with Runmeter. I surely hope it does, and I definitely will be spending a portion of my vacation tinkering with the the different screens.

                        <p>I was a huge watch person in the later years of high school and most of my college life. Then sometime in my senior year I stop wearing a watch. It wasn’t until early this year I start wearing a watch on a semi-regular basis.
                          <p>But first let me back track, once I decided I was going to make an attempt at the Goofy Challenge in `13 I wanted to find a way to track my effort in a quantitative way. I thought the best method would be using a hear rate monitor.
                            My main running gadget/companion up d to then had been my iPhone. Before the iPhone 4s if you wanted to use any fitness gadgets that would interact with an app on a smart phone you choice was ANT+ and a dongle. I just purchased
                            an iPhone 4s which support for Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Smart), so the obvious choice was the
                            <a href=http://www.wahoofitness.com/wahoo-blue-hr-heart-rate-strap.html>Wahoo Fitness Blue HR</a>. I used it for some time, but I son realized it wasn’t exactly what I wanted. I wasn’t a fan of the strap.
                            <p>Shortly after I started to cool on the HR Blue, I learned of the a new
                              <a href=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alphaheartrate/alpha-the-holy-grail-of-heart-rate-look-ma-no-hand title="ALPHA - the Holy Grail of Heart Rate (Look Ma, no hands!)">Kickstarter project</a> the
                              <a href=http://www.mioglobal.com/>Mio Alpha</a>, a heart rate monitor watch. The watch is great for the uni-tacker functionality it provides. I been slight curious of the smart watches entering the market over the last year, all of them like Pebble, never
                              excited me the all seemed more like a niche-fad than a useful product. That was until a few days ago when I read an execet review of the

                        <p>Each year, month, week and day we are moving awway from the classic personal computer paradigm and closer to some hybrid sci-fi paradigm geeks just lusted over as adolescents. With the rise of smart phones and cloud computing we
                          will soon find ourselves at a cross road wondering what to do with all of our data. Now I could go on and on about data portablity. I think a bigger issue exist, the storge of our data. How does one preserve their digital history.
                          <p>Ever since I moved to to linux as my day-to-day OS I’ve been searching for the best backup/sync solution. I want something I can trust, that has an ability to sync, revision/version control and most importantly I want a soulution
                            that I can easily archived data when on my iPhone or on OS X. I know back up and sync are two different problems, requiring differet solutions. However, the data I wish to keep synced between devices also happen to be important
                            enought for me to keep backed up.
                            <p>From what I can tell on a few “big box” solutions exist. In the past I have relied on
                              <a href=http://db.tt/Woq86zN>Dropbox</a> to help keep my data in sync, I really can’t see a time where Dropbox isn’t going to play a role… in what ever this quest is. Who doesn’t love Dropbox? It is great for sharing files and keeping data synced; great
                              as it is, it is not a backup solution.
                              <p>Last year I did purchase a backup plan at a discounted price, Crash Plan. I didn’t do much research on it, but for the price I just couldn’t resist. I later found out the client side software required Java, I’m not a fan
                                of running Java but I gave it spin and quickly dropped that solution. It seems like a good program, but ipt isn’t want I want/need.
                                <p>For awhile I’ve been doing my own thing using SparkleShare. At first glance this seems[^gitBackup] like a perfect solution, use anyone of the git based hosting solutions to to keep everything backed up and synced. This
                                  is great for little things that you wish to share, like your dotfiles or even your website. When the data becomes more personal, or work related you start looking at -crypto. Once you enable crypto Sparkleshare starts
                                  to break down. You no longer have easy access to files when away from your system and esentially loose revision control. In addition a
                                  <a href="http://www.quora.com/Git-revision-control/What-is-the-practical-maximum-size-of-a-Git-repository-full-of-text-based-data?share=1">git repository does have a practical size limit</a>.
                                  <p>A few weeks ago I tried duplicity, I like it but where do I store my off site backups? The logical solution seems to be
                                    <a href=http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>Amazon S3</a> or
                                    <a href=http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/>Amazon Glacier</a>. Both services are well tested and it is doubtful they will disappear anytime soon. This may be the best long term solution for deep archiving and will preserve some form of digital history.
                                    <p>I’ve also tried
                                      <a href=http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html>BitSync</a>, which keeps files in sync with amazing effecienty but for the sync to work more than one system, under your control, must be onlne. It also seems to be more or a niche geek solution.
                                      <p>For now I think I will be going with
                                        <a href=https://spideroak.com/download/referral/3dd319d4afeaad92c8672e76c8789ef2>SpiderOak</a>s. While SpiderOak may not be the most ideal solution for the preserving a persons digital history, it currently seems to be best of all the bad choices. I can then layer in the other systems/methods
                                        and allow SpiderOak to main heavy lifting.
                                        <p>Oh, I also have a lifetime account with StrongSpace… and while it can work as a backup solution and can sync via rsync. I must admit I don’t feel I can trust it as a long term solution. Not after the Joyent/TextDrive
                                          debacle.
                                          <p>[^gitBackup]: Though it sounds like Git would make an amazing backup tool, Git really doesn’t work out well for backups over the long term. Many solutions that are specifically designed for performing backups
                                            are even less expensive than GitHub’s Micro plan. (via:

                        <p>This summer I’ve accomplished a few task, and a few where placed on the back burner. After completing the summer vacation project, and then sitting on it, I finally did install Arch on my main laptop. I learned a good deal along
                          the way and I am fairly happy with the end results. I may have a more indept install ‘report’ detailing some of my choices. I may push that off until I finish my next Arch install project, my Mac Mini with a functional OS X VM
                          environment.
                          <p>I feel my running as been a success thus far. I’ve been able to put in a few 14-mile completing them faster than my fastest half marathon time. However, I feel as if my endurance isn’t where I want it just yet. My nutrition is
                            far from ideal this close to Marathon Weekend.
                            <p>And finally, I spent a few weeks slowly moving to Bootstrap3, and I think I finally transitioned everything over. I also made a few slight changes to the ‘theme’. I like the current design, I feel it is clean &amp; simple;
                              yet something is lacking. I’ve also yet to make a dent into learning Ruby via the

                        <p>Late last year, a few weeks before my third Wine &amp; Dine Half Marathon I suffered an injury to my knee. While I rested and worked out at the gym I had hopes I could not just salvage upcoming Wine &amp; Dine but become healthy
                          enough to run the Goofy in January. Well I was able to make it for the Wine &amp; Dine, yet I managed to re-aggravated the injury around the 3-mile marker. I endured by hoping and skipping my way to finish line. Once I crossed
                          the finish line I was certain I would have to drop out of the Goofy. Yet, a few weeks later I had a desire to at least line up and try. I went back to the gym followed a similar routine to the one I used to a few weeks earlier.
                          Well I finished both, and the knee injury wasn’t an issue.
                          <p>Flash forward to late April to early May, the injury returned. I have followed a similar recovery plan, yet I’m not seeing the same success. I’ve now started to implement a run walk mix. I’m using Runmeter to track all my stats,
                            I also use the built in interval trainer to prompt me when to run or walk. My current ratio is 2:45 run with a 1:15 walk. I think I need to a bit more complexity to this formula, after running this loop 10 times (40 minutes)
                            I think I would like to toss in a 3:30 run followed my a 1:30 walk. So far so go.</article>

                        <p>A month ago I thought I found my RSS reader solution in
                          <a href=https://www.commafeed.com/>CommaFeed</a>. However, after using it for a few days I found it just wasn’t what I needed. In fact I found it to be painfully slow. So I looked for alternative solutions and found
                          <a href=https://github.com/swanson/stringer>Stringer</a>. It is by far one of the best solutions I found. Yet it too had a problem, sometimes I’m not in the mood to read tech news, and wish to indulge in something else… and Stringer lacks folders.
                          <p>I also looked at
                            <a href=http://www.goread.io>Go Read</a>, but I don’t like the fact it is tied to my Google account. I found something I could live with, for now,
                            <a href=http://www.feedafever.com/>Fever</a>. Now it isn’t perfect, but it does auto update, which is fantastic for a self hosted app. It also supports folders, and as and API implemented by other apps. The fact Fever has an API used by other Apps to me is very
                            important as I honestly feel the native web UX &amp; UI is shamefully sub par. Now that I have a nice collect of feeds that I wish to follow I now find myself wanting to trim back a bit. Not only am I overwhelmed by the sheer
                            number of stories, but the aforementioned web interface makes reading my feeds a less than pleasurable experience. I suppose if my display had a higher resolution I might feel a little different.
                            <p>However, I do have a new plan, I will supplement my fever install with an install of Stringer. To me Stringer really excels with an easy to read interface. If spin a Stringer install and have it manage whatever my short term
                              interest might be I think I will be a happy boy yet again.</article>

                          <a href=http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/>Cinnamon</a> is starting to emerge as a strong contender, I am starting to grow fond of the environment. I wish Cinnamon was an independant

Without such seperation, lack of documantion and independant development cycle the project lacks transparency leaving the UX at the whim of the Mint dev team.

                          <p>Electing to use Cinnamon would be taking the easy way out along with the baggage associated with it. Cinnamon is a derivative of GNOME, which has a plethora of settings not always exposed to the user. One such setting is natural
                            scrolling, I have natural scrolling correctly configure in xorg.conf{.d}<pre><code>Section &quot;InputClass&quot;

   Option   &quot;HorizScrollDelta&quot;    &quot;-111&quot;
   ...
EndSection
</code></pre>
                            <p>Neither GNOME nor Cinnamon would honor this system wide defualt setting, so some tweaking in in order. I could use <code>dconf-editor</code> to follow the bread crumbs along the schema path below to alter the key value. A much
                              simpler and dare I say elegant solution exist:<pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad natural-scroll &quot;true&quot;

                                    <p>It is perfectly acceptable for Mint to spend their resources on improving Cinnamon for Mint. Speaking only as an end user not using a Mint distro, if I elect to use Cinnamon I would personally feel more comfortable

                        <p>This may sound like a horror story at first but I assure you it isn’t. I wanted to find a lightweight shoe comfortable to wear daily, with a low toe to heal drop. However this shoe wasn’t intended to be used for daily use but as
                          a gym workout shoe. Over the winter I’ve been eyeing up

                          </sup> line from a distance. Just a few weeks ago I stopped by my local Skechers Outlet, and picked up a new pair of shoes. I know, I’m bad for buying running shoes from a ‘big box’ store let alone an outlet. Don’t judge me just yet,
                          I went shopping for work shoes and walked out with a pair of work shoes and
                          <a href=http://skechersperformance.com/running/mens#/53555-gorun2>Skechers GOrun 2</a>.
                          <p>So far I must say I’m impressed as they just find a way on my feet, I’ve taken them few runs and gym trips. I did try going for a run without the insole liners. I was amazed how much of a difference the liners makes; I can see
                            why people would enjoy this feel however after one run I don’t its for me.
                            <p>Overall I must say the GOrun2 is currently favorite shoe. I don’t know if I could run any real distance in such a minimial shoe, I am going to try. I started my transition to a ‘minimal shoe’ last year with the Brooks Pure
                              Flow, I enjoyed the fit and feel of that shoe as well. As a whole I think the Pure line is was constructed to a higher standard. The only exception to that is the sole, feel the GOrun will last a bit longer as the miles build
                              up.

                        <p>A few months back I installed Ubuntu; shortly after that I moved to CrunchBang. For the most part I’ve enjoyed my experiences with CruncBang. The few things I haven’t enjoyed where directly related to it foundation, Debian. However,
                          I stuck with it and even upgraded the Macbook (4,1) replacing the HD with an SSD and doubling the RAM.
                          <p>I enjoyed the experience even more. Yet I keep feeling like the Debian base was holding me back. My use cases don’t require stability. For the last week I’ve been tinkering with ArchLinux. First in a VM, then finally my older
                            MacBook (2,1). The biggest headache to date, and I’m sure many more will come, has been the ability to boot the system. I was using the install CD as a bootstrap. Three days ago I started learning, more like glossing over,
                            how EFI booting works. Slowly I was able to build a semi-working boot system.
                            <p>The main important parts /boot/efi must be its own volume mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI/boot
                              <p>install refind and move the required bits over to /boot/efi/EFI/boot rename refind_ia32.efi to bootia32.efi (the 2,1 MacBook has a 32-bit efi) and your now able to boot into refind.</article>

                        <p>I’ve been going back and forth over this for the last week. I really want to do the the Wine &amp; Dine for the 4th year in a row, I really want to tackle the Dopey Challenge. I only have the ability to do one of the weekends.
                          I also don’t know if this how I wanted to spend a weeks vacation. In the end the bigger regret would be not doing the Dopey Challenge.

                        <p>Spring is in the air and I’ve been feeling the need to give the site a bit more personality. Currently I’m working on matching a few fonts together that should help shape the look and feel.
                          <p>For this I choose to look at the Google Web Fonts (maybe I should look at Font Squirrel next), it seemed to provide the best way to get ensure my choices would be available to all visitors of the site. Right now I’m enamored
                            with four unique fonts Arvo, Kameron, Overlock and Sintony. The mix of these four does seem a bit disjointed right now. I wonder what will make the cut.</article>

                        <p>I was never a Facebook fan. I get the general point of the service to easily stay connected to friends and family. However maybe its because I’m not an overly social person, I never understood why so many people view the internet
                          thru Facebook, or buy so heavily into the Facebook services. As a result I was more of a Twitter users.
                          <p>I’ve preferred Twitter to Facebook because it had an open feeling. Something more noble where the service was ‘we the people.’ Slowly that feeling is melting away. Many of the geek thought leaders have started looking else where.
                            One of the first attempts at replacing Twitter was
                            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identi.ca>identi.ca</a> back in the Twitter #failwhale days. It never caught on for various reasons. Today we have two other choices

                            <a href=http://tent.io/>Tent</a>.
                            <p>App.net made the first big splash with a unique funding method, ask your end users to fund you. App.net philosophy is pure it simple make the backbone for the developers to build off of and make the end user the consumer not
                              the product. It is a pay to play platform which will keep many away. At the same time I think that will help the service scale and allow for developers to build unique and interesting services for the next few years. The
                              Twitter like functionality (alpha) is just a quaint fundraising side show.
                              <p>We also have
                                <a href=http://tent.io/>Tent</a>. However, unlike App.net, tent isn’t a platform, its a protocol for social networking. Not only that it is decentralized, which will ensure it stay open. Yet that brings upon it many problems such as long term
                                interoperability. It isn’t a service nor is it a platform, but idea how social networking should function. I have high hope for the tent
                                <a href=https://tent.is/>status app, tent.is</a> and hope it takes off. I however feel it has many growing pains ahead, the potential user base already has ideas and expectations. The status app must either evolve meet those expectations or refine
                                itself to show the user a better way.
                                <p>Of course these are my quick thoughts and haven’t really spent much time looking App.net or Tent. I like what I see with Tent, so

                        <p>When I first started to run I would run excessive at the gym, indoors on a treadmill. The idea of running outside, where the elements and nature could interfere with my feeble attempt at running horrified me. I knew I need help
                          to start running, couch to 5k apps where all the rage. They where all relatively cheap and similarly priced at $2.99. I knew I would eventually outgrow the 5k apps, as I was targeting completing a half-marathon. If I could find
                          a training app that would aid in my endeavor I would be happy, I found such an app,
                          <a href=http://itunes.apple.com/app/run-mate/id322005319>Run Mate</a>.
                          <p>I would not generally classify Run Mate as useful app away from a treadmill, but I may be wrong. I’ve since moved on to other tools as I dread running indoors and the bulk of my running takes place outdoors. At the core, Run
                            Mate is a powerful, albeit, fickle utility. The User Interface shows some thought was give to the end user, Yet the UX is rough around the corners and implemented in the most vexing ways, that eventually grow tiresome. If you
                            choose to use Run Mate, ignore sound prompts and rely solely on the voice overs. Also, avoid all temptation to pick up your iOS device to multitask or change tracks.
                            <p>A user can easily create a training routine that fits their goals. I wanted to running an interval set using the
                              <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training#Little_method>Little Method</a> this evening at the gym. I quickly configure a training plan before stepping on the treadmill, six minutes in I wondered why the first prompt had yet to fire. I checked the Run Mate, and sure enough it was
                              on step four. I forgot that the sound prompts are essentially nonexistent, I changed the plan to use the dread voice prompts and started over.
                              <p>I fact I’ve never once heard a sound prompt from Run Mate until later in the evening after a podcast I was listing to ended. My eyes wondering where wondering the computer screen and I heard these faint repetitive pings in
                                the distant background. It was then I my ear buds where still affixed to my ears and my podcast was over. When I removed one bud the sound was isolated to the other ear. Odd, killing the process halted the pings, starting
                                a run started the pings again. So yes, not only are the sound prompts faint and nonexistent the are also unreliable.</article>

                          out the hard way the fitbit wasn’t water resistant at all. The fitbit also didn’t seem very durable construction wise, but I didn’t exactly wear it as directed. I’m sure that contributed to my original failing. Last year jawbone
                          released their failed entry into the space, with the

I really wanted to buy the One, but two things held me back. First, its pre-shipping order status and second the design looks similar enough
                            to the original created a love-hate connection in my mind. While the Zip had one negative in my book, no sleep tracking. I placed an order for my Zip.

                              I will wait and see product review of both the Zip and One before buy.</article>

                        <p>It is that time of year when Apple is poised to release yet another version of the iPhone. I recall my first
                          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone>iPhone</a>, the orginal, which I beat up fairly well. I bought it with the intent of jailbreaking it and running it of T-Mobile. I upgraded to the 3G a year later but this time I opted to sign up for an AT&amp;T contract. When
                          the
                          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4>iPhone 4</a> came out the 3G was slugish and I loved the ascetic look of the 4 and yes I did upgrade to the
                          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4s>iPhone 4S</a>, mostly for well I don’t know
                          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_v4.0>Bluetooth 4.0</a>. When Apple first announced the 4 I really couldn’t think of anything else I would want in a phone, err, pocket sized handheld mobile computer. So what could the iPhone [5s/6] offer that would compel me to upgrade
                          again next year? I am nearly certain the iPhone 5 will sport LTE, improved processing power, improved camera and a new dock port. The geek in me is looking forward to LTE, I didn’t want it last year, and I always welcome improved
                          processing power. Dock ports, I honestly don’t care one way of the other, and I really don’t take enough pictures to really care.
                          <p>What’s left for the 2013 iPhone? Processor/RAM/battery improvements.
                            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication>NFC</a>? That sound grand but would I find it useful in daily life? I know I would love to have less to carry around with me. However would enough terminals exist in my daily life that honor the Apple version of NFC? Doubtful.
                            Would I really use the NFC bits in the phone if I can’t use it on a regular basis? Very unlikely.
                            <p>I can’t wait to see what is announced tomorrow, nor can wait for the 2013 speculation to begin.</article>

                              <strong>The solution:</strong> Let’s call the directory where Jekyll is installed &amp; running from the root /. Heroku installs the applications gems in <code>/vendor</code>. When Jekyll builds the site it scans all files and folder
                              in the root file directory, including <code>/vendor</code>. Fix is to simple edit <code>_config.yml</code> and put <code>vendor</code> in the exclude array.</article>

                        <p>Once again I’m taking inspiration from Jonas Forsberg and

I think I will circle back around to his method eventually, but for now, while I build out the site I’m going to follow the don’t fix what isn’t broken
                          mantra.
                          <p>So for now no more ‘git push heroku master’… unless I’m fiddling with some config settings and something breaks…</article>

                        <p>Now that I have github -&gt; heroku publishing in place now is the time to setup even more over kill, heroku offers a few (2)5 MB Memcache Bucket.
                          <p>I made the following changes to <code>config.ru</code><pre><code class=lang-ruby>if memcache_servers = ENV[&quot;MEMCACHE_SERVERS&quot;]
    require &#39;dalli&#39;
    require &#39;rack-cache&#39;

    $cache = Dalli::Client.new
    use Rack::Cache,
        :verbose =&gt; true,
        :metastore =&gt; $cache,
        :entitystore =&gt; $cache
end
</code></pre>
                            <p>To test that caching is working use <code>ab</code> aka Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool and run <code>ab -n 500 -c 5 [hostname]</code>
                              <p>This will make 500 requst to [hostname] with 5 concurrent request.
                                <p>And to see if <code>Rack::Deflater</code> is working<pre><code>curl -I -H &quot;Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate&quot; [hostname]

sudo gem install bundler
heroku auth:login
git clone git@github.com:himynameisjonas/jekyll-heroku-unicorn.git
cd jekyll-heroku-unicorn
bundle install
heroku create
