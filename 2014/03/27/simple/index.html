        <p>Online shopping isn’t anything new to me, after all I was one of the first people to buy and HD TV online way back when… then when had my last eye check up and prescription I went to <a href=https://warbyparker.com/>Warby Parker</a>. The experience
          was rather quick and simple. Now when I’m looking to buy a new bed I’m following suit. However, I never thought about buying the little daily things online. I started looking into changing that by buying my shaving needs online from <a href=https://www.harrys.com/>Harrys</a>.
          <p>For some reason I felt the need to do a little research before making this particular purchase. I really don’t know why but I did… and who would have guested a site dedicated to “personal grooming intelligence for consumers by consumers” called
            <a href=http://www.razorpedia.com/>razorpedia</a> exist. Sometimes the simple things lead to the odd ball finds.
            <p>What did I think of my shaving set from Harry’s? First, I’ve only used the Mach line in the past; the Harry’s blades seem nice, albeit a bit narrower than I would have expected. I wouldn’t say they are any better or worse than what a person
              would find in the Mach lineup. I elected for the Truman handle, as I don’t need a luxury handle. I did feel the handle asperity lacking a little something to grip on to when your hands are wet and slippery. I also haven’t been able to figure
              out how to remove the blade heads… and finally the shaving cream. I’m not a fan, but I’m not a fan of shaving creams in general and prefer gels. I will have to give the cream a few more trials before I render my final judgment.</article>
