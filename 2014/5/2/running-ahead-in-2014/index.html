        </header>
        <p>One 1/3 of the year is gone. While the year started bang, since then I haven’t been running much. My desire to road has been dampened by the ‘harsh’ 2013-14 winter weather.
          <p>Yet, I’m still looking ahead at what my 2014 running goals might consist off. For the last two years I’ve been consumed with the Goofy and Dopey challenges. I love the runDisney events, I love getting away to warmer weather… but I need a slight
            break from the runDisney events. I know I will be kicking myself in late October for passing on the Wine &amp; Dine again this year. I will feel like the perfect chance of complete the Cost-to-Cost Challenge slipped away when the first Avengers
            Half marathon nears. I’m nearly certainly want to be in Florida running when Marathon Weekend rolls around in January.
            <p>I wanted this year to be a local year, and start out with the
              <a href=https://www.53riverbankrun.com/>Fifth Third River Bank Run</a>. The race is the largest 25k race in the country, the event even has a
              <a href=https://www.53riverbankrun.com/5k-25k-combo.php>5k/25k combo</a>. I seem to enjoy doing these challenges, so maybe… but what about the fall? I could stay hyper-local and run the
              <a href=http://www.thebrooksieway.com/>Brooksie</a>. I didn’t get excited with either of those races.
              <p>Then I learned about the
                <a href=http://www.groundhogmarathon.com/>Ground Hog Marathon &amp; Half Marathon</a>, and reading the FAQ the event seemed intriguing… but that is definitely not a race I would like to try anytime soon. However, I found out the race director also puts on the
                <a href=http://grandrapidsmarathon.com/>Grand Rapids Marathon</a> and I just love Grand Rapids. While I don’t want to put in the time and effort to run another full marathon I also have a deep desire to run another full. So in the back of my mind I’ve been targeting this race.
                <p>I still needed to do something in the spring. One late night I ventured online and purchased a bed, then I entered the uber-local
                  <a href=http://www.letsmovefestival.com/>Let’s Move Festival of Races</a>. It is so local I can walk to the start line.
                  <p>Then today, I found out
                    <a href=https://www.cedarpoint.com/>Cedar Point</a> has an inaugural half marathon coming up, and since
                    <a href=https://www.visitkingsisland.com>Kings Island</a> is also a “local” park (and worth a visit) and they are the same company I wondered if they have a race as well… and they do. One is in the spring the other is the fall. Maybe this will be a nice runDisney replacement?
                    <p>I have to May 15th decide upon the Grand Rapids Marathon.</article>
